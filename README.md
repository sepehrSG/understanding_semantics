# understanding_semantics
This is a tool I built for evaluating semantic relationships between two passages of text!


Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or later
- openai python package (make sure to have OpenAI API key configured as an environment variable)
- tkinter python package

Run gui.py and play around!
